# Project Description
This project is a simple game where the user is presented with two profiles from Instagram and has to guess which one has more followers. The game uses data stored in game_data.py and prints a logo using ASCII art. The user is asked to choose between A and B and their answer is checked against the number of followers of each profile. If the user's answer is correct, the game continues with the profile that has more followers, and if not, the game ends.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following modules to run:
### art
### game_data

## Usage
To play the game, simply run the main.py file in your Python environment. You will be presented with the two profiles and asked to choose between A and B. Enter your choice and the program will tell you if you are correct or not. If you are correct, the game will continue with the profile that has more followers, and if not, the game ends.

## Credits
The ASCII art used in the game was created using the art module.
